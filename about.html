                 <p>
                    I'm a first-generation college student born and raised in the Bay Area studying Cognitive Science with a minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley. 
                    In addition, I am also in the procress of obtaining the Berkeley Certificate of Design Innovation. 
                    I always had an interest for the human mind and therefore, the multisciplinary cognitive science degree program caught my eye. I am most
                    interested in human-centered design as I am passionate about making experiences better for people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On campus, I like to hone my design skills through taking on a role for organizations that I am passionate about.
                    Outside of academics, I like to dance, explore bookstores, play cozy video games, make Spotify playlists, and watch sitcoms!
