    <h1>Who is Sara?</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a first-generation college student from the Bay Area studying Cognitive Science with a minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley. 
        In addition, I am also in the procress of obtaining the Berkeley Certificate of Design Innovation. 
        Coming into Berkeley as an intended computer science major as a freshman, I was unsure of my path. However, I always had an interest
        for the human mind and therefore, the multisciplinary cognitive science degree program caught my eye. I am most
        interested in human-centered design as I am passionate about making experiences better for people.
    </p>

    <p>
        On campus, I like to hone my design skills through taking on a role for organizations that I am passionate about.
        Outside of academics, I like to dance, play cozy video games, make Spotify playlists, and watch sitcoms!
