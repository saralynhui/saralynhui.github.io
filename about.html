                    I am a recent UC Berkeley graduate with a B.A. in Cognitive Science and a minor in Data Science. Studying the complexity of the mind
                    with an analytical background has equipped me with the tools to make designs user-friendly and appealing to the human eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my time at Berkeley, I'd hone my design skills through taking on social media/publicity roles for organizations that I am passionate about.  
                    Outside of academics, I like to dance, explore bookstores, play cozy video games, make Spotify playlists, and watch sitcoms!
